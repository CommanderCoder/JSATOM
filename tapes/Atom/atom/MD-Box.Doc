Mouse-Dos Box v1.01                                                     W.Ras
=============================================================================



INTRODUCTION
------------
The Mouse-Dos Box is a toolbox at A000h with a couple of routines, for easy
mouse control. It also supplies a few useful disk routines. All four of these
disk command select the DOS automatically.
All statements described below can be used in direct mode as well as in
your own BASIC programs.



MOUSECURSORS
------------
As far as the emulated ATOM is concerned, the mouse is a hardware mouse.
There are 32 different mouse cursors defined.



STATEMENTS
----------

  MDBOX   (MD.)
    Shows MouseBox version and all available statements

  SHOWMOUSE <factor>   (SHOW.)
    Turns on the mouse cursor. There are 32 different mouse cursors
    defined (0-31). Factors higher than or equal to 80h (128), switch off
    the mouse cursor.

  HIDEMOUSE   (HI.)
    Turns off the mouse cursor.

  GETMOUSE <variable1>,<variable2>,<variable3>   (GETM.)
    Returns mouse position and button status. The horizontal position is
    returned in <variable1>, the vertical position in <variable2>, and
    the button status is returned in <variable3>.

  PLACEMOUSE <x-pos>,<y-pos>   (PL.)
    Positions the mouse cursor. The mouse cursor is not turned on or off by
    this command.

  SANDGLASS   (SAN.)
    This command switches on the mouse cursor, and enables the IRQ through
    VIA timer 1. The interrupt handler scrolls through mouse cursors 8 - 11,
    which are four different sand-glasses.
    The interrupt handler is positioned inside the MouseBox toolbox. However,
    this does not effect the usage of other boxes; the MouseBox is automati-
    cally selected when the IRQ handler is called, until the end of the IRQ
    routine, after which the previous toolbox is selected again, in order to
    resume execution.

  NOSANDGLASS   (NOS.)
    This command terminates the IRQ routine and hides the mouse cursor.



  INFALL   (INF.)
    Shows information about all the files in a disk image in the last used
    drive. During the listing of INFALL, the PageMode is active.

  COMPACT <drive number>   (COM.)
    Removes all redundant space in a disk image. This command uses the
    memory area 8200h-91FFh as buffer space. All data in this memory range
    will be destroyed. This command should not be used in GRMOD.

  VIEW <drive number>   (VI.)
    Graphically displays all sectors on the disk in the specified drive
    and whether or not they are occupied. This command uses a buffer area
    at 8500h-86FFh.

  TYPE <filename>   (TY.)
    Displays the contents of the named file on the screen. The file is
    searched on the disk in the last used drive. This command is meant
    especially for ASCII files.

  START <drive number>   (STA.)
    Starts a program from disk. It is not necessary to enter the DOS first.
    A list of all the files on the disk will be shown, preceeded by a letter.
    On typing a letter, the corresponding program is started in one of four
    possible ways:
    -If both the start address and the execution address are 0000h, the
     program is considered to be a text and the *EXEC command is executed.
    -If the start address is 2900h and the execution address is C2B2h, a
     CHAIN command is issued. The program is loaded in the current page
     (?#12), then TOP and the free space pointer are set correctly, and
     finally, the program is run.
    -If the start address is anything but 2900h, but the execution address
     is C2B2h, a *LOAD command is performed.
    -In all other cases, the *RUN command is executed.
