1. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
AtomCom is a small utility for transferring files between a PC and the ATOM.
This program requires the following configuration:

-80286 CPU,
-SoundBlaster 2.0 or better.



2. CONNECTOR CABLE
------------------
When transferring files from the ATOM to the PC or vice versa, use the
following pinconfigurations:

+-----
|
|     ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»        -When transferring files from the ATOM to the PC,
|   ÉÍ¼    þ    ÈÍ»       connect the LINE IN plug on your sound card to
|   º  þ   2   þ  º       the ATOM's tape port, using pin 2 as ground and
|   º             º       pin 1 as output signal from the ATOM.
|   º þ1       3þ º
|   º             º      -When transferring files from the PC to the ATOM,
|   º  þ       þ  º       connect the LINE OUT or SPEAKERS plug on your
|   ÈÍ»   ÚÄ¿   ÉÍ¼       sound card to the ATOM's tape port, using pin 2
|     ÈÍÍÍ¾ ÔÍÍÍ¼         as ground and pin 3 as input signal to the ATOM.
|                         On my ATOM, the input signal needs to be pretty
| Female connector SK2    strong. It might be convenient to disconnect your
|     on the ATOM         speakers while transferring files to the ATOM.

3. TRANSFERRING FILES
---------------------
Start the AtomCom utility. The sound card will be identified and its
parameters will be shown on screen. You'll enter the main menu:

+-----
|
|  M A I N   M E N U
|
|  1   : Transfer data from PC to ATOM,
|  2   : Transfer data from ATOM to PC,
|  Esc : Return to OS.
|
+-----


3.1 FROM PC TO ATOM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll be asked for a filename to be transferred. It must be an .ATM file.
See documentation of the Acorn Atom Emulator for more information.
The file's parameters will then be shown, e.g.

+-----
|
|  INVADERS          2900 3C00 CE86
|
+-----

The first number being the start address, the second the end address + 1,
and the last the execution address (all hexadecimal).
You will then be asked to enter the rate at which data will be transferred,
either 300 bps or 1200 bps. Then you will be asked to enter a start address
and end address for this file. They must be within the range just shown,
which are the default values (in other words: the complete file). After that,
transfer will start. Be sure to have the Atom ready, by typing the following:

+-----
|
|  FCOS <Enter>                 (set tape speed to 1200 bps, if available)
|  LOAD "<filename>" <2xEnter>  (any COS command may be used, i.e. *LOAD,
|                                *RUN, *FLOAD).
+-----

While data traffic takes place, the PC will show its progress.


3.2 FROM ATOM TO PC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following message will appear on the screen:

+-----
|
|  Receive status:
|  Waiting for control block...
|
+-----

Now, type the following on your ATOM:

+-----
|
|  FCOS <Enter>                 (set tape speed to 1200 bps, if available)
|  SAVE "<filename>" <2xEnter>  (the COS command *SAVE may also be used)
|
+-----

The PC will automatically recognize both 300 bps and 1200 bps. It is not
necessary to select a speed first.
While data traffic takes place, the PC will show its progress.

If the PC encounters an error (e.g. checksum error), you will be asked if
you would like to save the data reveiced prior to the occurrance of the
error or not. Transfer will then have to be restarted.
Concatenating incomplete files has to be done manually. Please refer to the
documentation of the Atom Emulator for information on the .ATM file format.



4. QUESTION & ANSWER
--------------------
Q.  When transferring files from the ATOM to the PC, the PC complains about
    a corrupted control block or misformed wave patterns.
A1. Check the baudrate on both machines.
A2. You must always use named files, i.e. files which are devided into 256
    byte blocks preceded by control blocks.
A3. Check the connector cable between ATOM and PC. See also A3 of the next
    question.

Q.  The ATOM doesn't receive files from the PC or gives checksum errors.
A1. Check the baudrate on both machines.
A2. Use a higher output volume.
A3. Check the connector cable between ATOM and PC. I use a cable of about
    1.5 meters without problems. On the PC's side is the jack plug; on the
    ATOM's side of the cable I soldered ironwires two both wires and stuck
    those into the ATOM's tape port in the appropiate pinholes.

Q.  I have some more ATOM files, that are not on your page yet. Would you
    like to have them?
A.  Yes please! I'd love to see them. See chapter 6 for my addresses.
