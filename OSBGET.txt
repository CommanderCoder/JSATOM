FB81: the wait for 0.5 seconds is set a counter to 30 and wait for 30 x 60ths of a second.

FB83: Using CRT flyback (FE66) to register a 60th

FB8E - read header and test for unnamed
i.e. wait 2 seconds - this is 4096 cycles (0x1000)
Cpu runs at 1Mhz - 1,000,000 clocks per second.  

FCBD - 
Then read 4 bytes ‘****’ using OSBGET : Y = number of bytes to read

Workspace for OSBGET is D8 to D4 backwards
Transition counter - first ‘0’ START BIT - 8 BITS then ‘1’ STOP BIT
8 transitions is a 0 and 16 transitions is a 1.  OSBGET checks against 12 - if it reaches 12 then got a 1

Takes 3.3ms to get through a loop 53 times and the transitions indicate a 1 or 0

Get pulse from B002 and use FCCD to test it.

ROR : Carry flag is shifted into bit 7 and bit 0 is shifted into carry


=== OSBPUT
Send 10 bits for each byte - 1 start 8 data 1 stop - bit to send is stored in CARRY using FC90 to decide

To Send a 1 - 8 cycles of 2.4khz, (3LSBs of PIA set high). (Bit 2 is loudspeaker!)
To Send a 0 - 4 cycles of 1.2khz, (2LSBs of PIA set low) tape output high Then set LSB of PIA high - tape output low 

Use FC9C to write a 0 - disable 2.4Khz, wait for falling edge output is high.  Tape out low - do this 4 times.
Do again but with next bit in the CARRY

Write 8 cycles of 2.4khz (a 1 bit for START but)

FCC2-FCC8
Test 255 times and then give up - did it find bit within 8 though?

FCBD - duration of tape pulse

FCCD - uses C5 to store the bit but Z is SET if there is NO change between last and current bit in b002
